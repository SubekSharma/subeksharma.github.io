  "researchSectionText": "Recently, I secured funding from the University Grant Commission (UGC) to embark on a research journey focused on tackling anemia among pregnant women in Nepal. Engaging in numerous proposal defenses across hospitals, our mission was clear: harness the potential of deep learning algorithms to predict anemia more effectively. Actively participating in data collection across diverse hospital settings, I acquired invaluable expertise in research methodology, data analysis, communication, leadership, and management. This immersive experience also afforded me the opportunity to cultivate meaningful connections with esteemed senior doctors, aspiring medical students, and influential hospital committees. Through collaboration and dedication, we're poised to make significant strides in addressing this pressing healthcare challenge and positively impact maternal health outcomes."
