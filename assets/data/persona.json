  "researchSectionText": "I, along with my friends, received funding from the University Grant Commission (UGC) for a research project aimed at addressing anemia among pregnant women in Nepal. Our goal was clear: to use deep learning algorithms to predict anemia more accurately. We conducted proposal defenses at various hospitals, focusing on gathering data effectively. This experience honed my skills in research methodology, data analysis, communication, leadership, and management. Moreover, I had the chance to build relationships with senior doctors, medical students, and hospital committees. Together, we're committed to making significant progress in improving maternal health outcomes by tackling this important healthcare challenge."
